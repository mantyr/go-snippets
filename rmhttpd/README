There are three HTTP servers here, two in Go and the
one by Raluca that inspired me (slighty modified). I
found it hard to resist error checking at first, so
maybe all those error results in the documentation do
encourage people to check. Checking all of them is,
however, quite painful. So sadly this experiment did
not help me to figure out if I want exceptions in Go
or not. :-/

All of these are toys, use them as such. Don't start
uninstalling Apache. :-D
