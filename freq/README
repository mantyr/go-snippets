There are four implementations of freq here, two in Go,
one in Python, and the original C code; I've added the
C version simply for convenience, I hope this is "fair
use" of the code. The Makefile has a "test" target that
makes sure the programs agree in their output and times
them for comparison.

As it stands, the Go implementations perform worse than
the C code but better than the Python code in terms of
speed. This roughly confirms claims made on the Go site.
However, both Go versions are more verbose, at least in
my current programming style. So at least for small toy
programs, Go has not met that goal yet.
